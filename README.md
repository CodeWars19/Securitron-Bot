# Securitron-Bot

This is a bot I made for discord based on the Securitron from Fallout: New Vegas. The bot moderates servers, censors inappropriate messages, 
allows administrators to kick and suspend users with ease, and can even play games.

The bot is currently a work in progrress. It runs on a few servers and will be updated to run 24/7

To view bot commands, access the "commands" folder.

Updates and commmands to the bot will be listed here over time.
